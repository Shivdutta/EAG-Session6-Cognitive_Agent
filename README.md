## üß† What is a Cognitive Agent?

A cognitive agent is an intelligent software (or robotic) system designed to mimic aspects of human cognition‚Äîlike perception, memory, reasoning, learning, planning, and decision-making‚Äîin order to operate autonomously in complex environments.

### ‚ú® Key Features of a Cognitive Agent:

- **üëÅÔ∏è Perception**  
  Gathers data from the environment (e.g., through sensors, APIs, or user input) and interprets it.

- **üß† Memory**  
  Stores knowledge, past experiences, or learned patterns to support future decisions.

- **üß© Reasoning / Decision-Making**  
  Chooses actions based on goals, current perceptions, and past knowledge. Can involve rule-based logic, planning algorithms, or learned behaviors.

- **üìö Learning**  
  Improves over time through interaction with its environment‚Äîusing methods like reinforcement learning, supervised learning, or symbolic updates.

- **ü§ñ Action**  
  Executes tasks or affects its environment through outputs, actuators, or commands.

### üí° Example Use Cases:

- üó£Ô∏è Personal assistants like Siri or Alexa
- üè≠ Warehouse/logistics agents that plan forklift training or manage stock
- üéÆ Game AIs that adapt to player strategies
- üöú Autonomous robots navigating unpredictable terrain
- üí¨ Customer support bots that improve through interaction

# üè¢ Logistics & Warehouse Automation Agent ü§ñ

An interactive cognitive agent built with **Chainlit** and **Gemini API**, designed to optimize warehouse logistics and automation workflows.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Smart interaction using natural language queries.
- Suggests KPIs, optimizes warehouse layout, routes, inventory, and more.
- Executes reasoning and tool-based actions using Gemini LLM.
- Memory system to store and recall preferences.
- Tool execution via MCP server with JSON-based `FUNCTION_CALL`s.
- Fully interactive UI with **Chainlit**.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/warehouse-agent.git
cd warehouse-agent
```

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

---

### 3. Run the Agent (Chainlit UI)

```bash
chainlit run chainlit_app.py
```

This will open a browser window. You'll be prompted to enter:

- ‚úÖ Gemini API Key  
- üè¢ Warehouse Location  
- üì¶ Daily Shipment Volume  
- ü§ñ Automation Level  

Then, you can chat with the agent using natural language!

### üß† Perception ‚Üí üßæ Decision ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Action ‚Üí üí¨ Final Answer

#### 1. Perception: Gemini reads query

```python
# perception.py
async def perceive(input_data: PerceptionInput) -> PerceptionOutput:
    ...
    response = await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(
        None,
        lambda: client.models.generate_content(
            model=llm,
            contents=prompt
        )
    )
    return PerceptionOutput(llm_prompt=prompt, model_response=response.text.strip())
```

---

#### 2. Decision: Parses LLM response

```python
# decision.py
if text.startswith("FUNCTION_CALL:"):
    ...
    return DecisionOutput(action_type="function_call", tool_name=data['name'], arguments=data['arguments'])
```

---

#### 3. Action: Runs MCP Tool via Client

```python
# action.py
async def call_mcp_tool(tool_name: str, arguments: dict) -> str:
    server_params = StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",
        args=["mcp_server.py", "--env-key", os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")]
    )
    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            await session.initialize()
            result = await session.call_tool(tool_name, arguments)
            return str(result.content if hasattr(result, 'content') else result)
```

---

## üß† Memory-Based System Prompt

The `agent.py` file retrieves user preferences from memory to construct the system prompt:

```python
store_memory(MemoryInput(key="user_preferences", value=preferences))

memory_data = get_memory("user_preferences")

system_prompt = (
    "You are a logistics and warehouse automation agent specialized in supply chain optimization, "
    "inventory control, and efficiency strategies.
"
    f"Warehouse: {memory_data.get('warehouse_location', 'unknown')}
"
    f"Daily Shipments: {memory_data.get('shipment_volume', 'unknown')}
"
    f"Automation: {memory_data.get('automation_level', 'unknown')}"
)
```

---

## üß∞ MCP Server (Tool Logic)

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def suggest_kpis() -> dict:
    prompt = "Suggest 5 key performance indicators (KPIs) for warehouse and logistics operations."
    result = await call_llm(prompt)
    return {"content": [TextContent(type="text", text=result)]}
```

To run the server via stdio:

```python
# mcp_server.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")
```
